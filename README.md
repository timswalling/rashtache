# Rash 'Tache

Build pattern libraries quickly using shared Mustache partials with overloading.

## Quick start

Set up folders containing Mustache partials and the corresponding JSON data. If
shared partials are used, make sure the folder structure is identical in each
project.

Use lowercase names with dashes for all files and folders, and use the
corresponding camelCase name within templates for all partials and variables.
